- Building round-robin scheduling algorithm
- Handling capacity constraints and edge cases

## Recent Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Project Foundation
- Set up comprehensive project structure with proper directory organization
- Configured Dynaconf for flexible environment-based configuration
- Added all necessary dependencies including FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, OAuth libraries

### ‚úÖ Data Models
- Implemented complete SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships
- Added OAuth2 integration with User and OAuthAccount models
- Created comprehensive Event, Attendee, Round, Match, and QRLogin models
- Added business logic methods and properties to models
- Implemented security features like QR token hashing and validation

### ‚úÖ Documentation
